            <h1 id="authorName">Kabir</h1>
            <p id="authorInfo">Kabir (1398â€“1518)was a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint. His writings influenced Hinduism's
                Bhakti movement, and his verses are found in Sikhism's scripture Guru Granth Sahib, the Satguru Granth
                Sahib of Saint Garib Das,and Kabir Sagar. Born in the city of Varanasi in what is now Uttar Pradesh,
                he is known for being critical of both organized religion and religions. He questioned what he regarded 
                to be the meaningless and unethical practices of all religions, primarily what he considered to be the
                wrong practices in the Hindu and Muslim religions.During his lifetime, he was threatened by both 
                Hindus and Muslims for his views.When he died, several Hindus and the Muslims he had inspired claimed 
                him as theirs.Kabir suggested that "Truth" is with the person who is on the path of righteousness, considered
                everything, living and non living, as divine, and who is passively detached from the affairs of the world.
                To know the Truth, suggested Kabir, drop the "I", or the ego. Kabir's legacy survives and continues through
                the Kabir panth ("Path of Kabir"), a religious community that recognises him as its founder and is one of the
                Sant Mat sects. Its members are known as Kabir panthis.
